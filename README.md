#PiSharpIR

Python module designed to use a Sharp GP2Y0E02B I2C IR distance sensor on a Raspberry Pi.

Currently can read distances, more features still in development.
The GP2Y0E02B Datasheet can be found [here](http://www.sharp-world.com/products/device/lineup/data/pdf/datasheet/gp2y0e02b_e.pdf), application note [here](http://www.sharp-world.com/products/device-china/lineup/data/pdf/datasheet/gp2y0e02_03_appl_e.pdf).

Run [example.py](/master/example.py) if you would like to see how it works.

CHANGELOG:
Added range selector, can choose between 64cm and 128cm
